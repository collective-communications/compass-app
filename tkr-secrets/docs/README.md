# tkr-secrets

Encrypted secrets vault with a browser UI and REST API. Store API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive credentials in AES-256-GCM encrypted vaults with multi-vault support, group organization, and password recovery via BIP39 mnemonic phrases.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the dev server (port 3000, hot reload)
bun run dev

# Open the UI
open http://localhost:3000
```

## What You Get

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** with Scrypt KDF — secrets encrypted at rest
- **Multi-vault** — independent vaults with separate passwords and auto-lock timers
- **Recovery keys** — 24-word BIP39 mnemonic, hex, or QR code to recover a forgotten password
- **Groups and ordering** — organize secrets into named groups with drag-and-drop reorder
- **.env import** — two-phase preview-then-confirm import from standard `.env` files
- **Auto-lock** — configurable timeout zeroes the vault key from memory
- **Stay authenticated** — opt-in macOS Keychain persistence for auto-unlock across restarts
- **Light/dark theme** — follows system preference, toggle in the UI
- **No plaintext export** — secrets never leave the vault unencrypted

## Architecture

Three-tier design: Crypto Core → HTTP API → Browser UI.
